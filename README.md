# No-NA-in-Policies-Data-By-Country
 CSV Hub for files for Stats M148. This is part of a greater project by Kelly Lei, Shin Naganuma, and Christy Hui. 
 
 The data was manipulated with before being extracted into these different CSV files.
 
 The data sets consist of 84 countries, containing information on their policies and COVID-related statistics.
 
 Before extraction, there consisted of 179 countries. However, some countries had NAs for every single date for one or more policies.
 
 The countries that had did not have NAs for every single data for one or more policies can be found here (i.e. the US has NAs; however, since it there is info on its policy data in eventual dates, it was included).
 
 Policy data was taken from Oxford University's COVID tracker, which can be found here:
